                                <p>Green-n-Personal is a Jaipur based start-up project. We started with an idea to solve a real problem that we were facing. One of our family members was getting married and we wanted an easy, fast and personal way to invite our guests.</p>
                                <p>The printed cards were a no go for us for several reasons. Firstly, they are very inconvenient and expensive. It takes many days to get them printed, and then distributing the cards is a monumental task too. It not only takes a lot of time and money (travel), it takes a toll on health. You have to go to everybody’s house in traffic and pollution, and you end up consuming a lot of unnecessary calories in sweets and tea. This also adds one more tasks to an already huge wedding tasks list. Second, the printed cards are not good for the environment. We estimated that 200 printed paper cards roughly equal to cutting at least one tree. And this paper is wasted eventually. Printed paper cards are a relatively recent phenomenon, and are totally avoidable with the right technology.</p>
                                <p>We wanted a technological solution, which can avoid these problems. We wanted to create a personalized video that we could share with our guests over whatsapp or other social media, and follow up with a call. We found many online video invitation solutions, but they were very expensive. A bigger problem was that they were not personalizable, they would give you a single video for all the guests. But we wanted something personal. We wanted to invite each of our guest by their own personal names, like we do on a printed card. We were not able to find a single solution that was affordable.</p>
                                <p>Coming from an engineering background, we decided to take the challenge, and solve the problem ourselves. With a lot of hard work, we were able to prepare a first prototype. Our family loved it, and all our guests loved it. Best part was that it was green and personal.</p>
                                <p>This is how Green-n-Personal was born. An easy, fast and personal way to reach out to large number of people. It’s Green. It’s personal.</p>
                                <p>Our first attempt took us 1 hour per video. Currently we are taking under 30 seconds to prepare one video. With our ongoing research and development, along with our investment in digital infrastructure, we are targeting near real time video generation. </p>
                                <p>Our customers love it, and we are sure you will love it too.</p>
                                <p>Whether you want a personal invite for guests at your party, or you want to reach out to customers in a very personal way, we are here to help. </p>
